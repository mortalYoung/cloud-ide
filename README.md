# CloudIDE

This is an experimental project for exploering the possibility of creating a CloudIDE based on [molecule](https://github.com/DTStack/molecule)


Besides, it's also a challenge about How to achieve a CloudIDE. For now, we have met the problems which were not only Front-end, but aslo Back-end. 


The Server of this repository is in [cloudide-server](https://github.com/mortalYoung/cloudide-server).
